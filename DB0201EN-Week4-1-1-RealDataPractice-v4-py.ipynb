    "\n",
    "The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. The dataset is available from the Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes a large number of metrics. Start by familiarizing yourself with the types of metrics in the database: https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/AAD41A13-BE8A-4E67-B1F5-86E711E09D5F?download=true\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: Do not download the dataset directly from City of Chicago portal. Instead download a more database friendly version from the link below.\n",
    "Now download a static copy of this database and review some of its contents:\n",

    "### Store the dataset in a Table\n",
    "In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. To analyze the data using SQL, it first needs to be stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is easier to read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and then PERSIST it into the database as we saw in the previous lab, it results in mapping to default datatypes which may not be optimal for SQL querying. For example a long textual field may map to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, __it is highly recommended to manually load the table using the database console LOAD tool, as indicated in Week 2 Lab 1 Part II__. The only difference with that lab is that in Step 5 of the instructions you will need to click on create \"(+) New Table\" and specify the name of the table you want to create and then click \"Next\". \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Now open the Db2 console, open the LOAD tool, Select / Drag the .CSV file for the CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS dataset and load the dataset into a new table called __SCHOOLS__.\n",
